"Is Unique","Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?","Arrays and Strings","String","Boolean","Cannot use data structures","[[ ""apple"" ],[ ""bananna"" ],[ ""aeiou"" ]]","[false, false, true]","Medium","1. Try a Hash Table; 2. Could a bit vector be useful?; 3. Can you solve it in O(N log N) time?"
"Check Permutation","Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.","Arrays and Strings","String","Boolean","Case sensitive and whitespace is significant","[[ ""abc de"", ""de abc"" ],[ ""Hello"", ""olleh"" ]]","[true, false]","Medium","1. Could a Hash Table be useful; 2. Strings have same characters but in different orders"
"URLify","Write an method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.","Arrays and Strings","String","String","You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters and that you are given the true length","[[ ""app le"" ],[ ""banan a"" ]]","[[ ""app%20le"" ],[ ""banan%20a"" ]]","Easy","1. You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count them?"
"Palindrome Permutation","Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.","Arrays and Strings","String","Boolean","The palindrome does not need to be limited to dictionary words.","[[ ""Tact Coa"" ],[ ""abc"" ]]","[true, false]","Medium","1. Have you tried a Hash Table?; 2. Can you reduce space usage by using a bit vector?; 3. What characteristic does a palindrome permutation have?"
"One Away","Given two strings write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edit) away","Arrays and Strings","String","Boolean","There are three types of edit: insert, remove, or replace.","[[ ""pale"", ""ple"" ],[ ""pale"", ""bale"" ],[ ""pale"", ""bake"" ]]","[true, true, false]","Medium","1. Can you do all 3 checks in a single pass?"
"String Compression","Implement an method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.","Arrays and Strings","String","String","If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters.","[[ ""aabcccccaaa"" ],[ ""abc"" ]]","[[ ""a2b1c5a3"" ],[ ""abc"" ]]","Medium","1. First compress the string, then check the length."
"Rotate Matrix","Given an image represented by an N×N matrix, where each pixel is 4 bytes, rotate the image by 90 degrees.","Arrays and Strings","Data Structure","Data Structure","Can you do this in place?","[[[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]]","[[[7, 4, 1],[8, 5, 2],[9, 6, 3]]]","Medium","Can you rotate one layer at a time?"
"Zero Matrix","Write an algorithm such that if an element in an M×N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.","Arrays and Strings","Data Structure","Data Structure","None","[[[1, 2, 3],[4, 0, 6],[7, 8, 9]]]","[[[1, 0, 3],[0, 0, 0],[7, 0, 9]]]","Hard","Lazy"
"String Rotation","Given two strings, s1 and s2, check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to is_substring.","Arrays and Strings","String","Boolean","None","[[ ""waterbottle"", ""erbottlewat"" ],[ ""hello"", ""helol"" ]]","[true, false]","Medium","Lazy"
